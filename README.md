# Project #: Experiments with Hashing

## Overview
Implements a Hashtable class with open addressing by inserting n HashObject 
objects into a specific hash table of size m until we get a load factor Î± defined 
as n/m. The project looks at the use of linear probing and double hashing, 
and their performance.

## Reflection
I feel this was one of the tougher challenges so far. I think it was because
there was a lot less instruction included with this one, like not being told
was specific methods I would need. I just decided to take it as I went, and 
added certain methods and functions when I found a need for them.

This reflection would be far too long if I talked about everything I struggled 
with. The checking of conditions everywhere fried my brain, because I had to keep 
going back to find which one was breaking my program. Eventually got through it
and had some nice output. 

## Compiling and Using
Compile with 
        javac HashtableExperiment.java

Usage: java HashtableExperiment <dataSource> <loadFactor> [<debugLevel>]
       <dataSource>: 1 ==> random numbers
                     2 ==> date value as a long
                     3 ==> word list
       <loadFactor>: The ratio of objects to table size, 
                       denoted by alpha = n/m
       <debugLevel>: 0 ==> print summary of experiment
                     1 ==> save the two hash tables to a file at the end
                     2 ==> print debugging output for each insert
